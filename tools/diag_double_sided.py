"""Is the geometry already double-sided, or does the material flag have to be?

Every material in this PMX sets flag bit 0 ("draw both sides"), which MMD
honours at render time.  X4 does not read PMX flags, so a single-sided mesh
would lose half its faces the moment the camera crosses it -- the classic
"the hair disappears when I look from the other side".

There are two ways the source can be safe:

  * the author mirrored the geometry, so a coincident, oppositely-wound copy
    of every thin surface already exists in the mesh (what the previous
    project's model did), or
  * they did not, and the replacement has to duplicate the faces itself.

Measured by hashing each face's sorted vertex positions and counting the pairs
that share a position set but have opposite winding.
