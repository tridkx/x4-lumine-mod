"""Enumerate every Terran-**race** female NPC macro the mod has to rewrite.

Why not just patch the base macro
---------------------------------
`character_terran_female_cau_base_01_macro` is what the others inherit from,
so patching it looks like the whole job.  It is not: every derived macro carries
its own `<models>` block, which shadows the base's.  (Argon women -- the
previous project -- inherit their models, which is why that one only needed its
appearance pools rewritten.  Nothing about this carries across a race.)

So each macro's `<models>` is replaced individually.  That is strictly better
than rewriting the appearance pools: the pools keep selecting different macros,
so NPC identities (names, backgrounds, job titles) stay varied and only the body
changes -- and story/plot NPCs that no pool reaches are covered too.

How a macro is classified
-------------------------
By the *effective* `race` and `female` flags, resolved along the `ref` chain,
and by faction.  Matching on the name instead gets this wrong in both
directions, which is worth spelling out because the names are so suggestive:

    character_yaki_female_cau_base_01_macro         race="argon"     NOT terran
    character_yaki_female_plot_yaki_civilian_macro  race="terran"    IS terran
    character_player_custom_f_terran_cau_macro      race="terran"
                                                 faction="player"    the player
    character_scenario_combat_ter_gunner_macro   torso char_ter_m_pilot_suit_01
                                                                     male
    character_scenario_combat_ter_marine_macro   no gender in the name, female
                                                 only via its ref     female

The Yaki are an Argon-race gang, but at least one Yaki story NPC is authored as
a Terran; and the player's own custom character is `race="terran"` as well,
which would hand the player Lumine's body -- and fight the character creator.

One more rule is needed on top of `race`: the two diplomat macros
(`character_ter_f_diplomat_01_macro`, `character_pio_f_diplomat_01_macro`)
`ref` the *Argon* helper macro, so they resolve to `race="argon"` -- yet the
Terran and Pioneer diplomat pools select them and their torsos are
`char_ter_f_diplomat_suit_01` / `char_pio_f_diplomat_suit_01`.  By race they
are Argon; by every appearance pool the player meets them as Terran faction
members.  So a macro also qualifies when it is female and **reachable from a
`terran.*` or `pioneers.*` female appearance pool**.

The pool test is what keeps that rule honest.  "Wears a Terran body" alone
would also have caught `character_yki_f_diplomat_01_macro`, which is a Yaki
diplomat that happens to be issued the same suit -- replacing it would put
Lumine in a Yaki faction slot that has nothing to do with Terrans.  What
decides is who selects the macro, not what it wears.

Prints the list; `make_mod.py` reads the JSON this writes.
