"""PMX (MMD) rig -> X4 Argon/Terran female Biped mapping for 荧 (Lumine).

Target
------
The X4 Terran female NPC macros reference `<component ref="character_argon_female_01" />`
-- the *same* shared component as the Argon women, so the skeleton, the 1100+
animations and the eye look-at all come from the identical 91-bone Biped the
previous project targeted.  Nothing about the rig changes; only which
appearance pools point at the result does.

Frame
-----
Measured, not assumed (`check_winding.py`):

    左目   - 頭       = (0, +0.68, -0.72)   eyes in front
    齿下   - 頭       = (0,  0.00, -1.08)   teeth in front
    左足先EX - 左足首D = (0, -0.43, -0.83)   toes in front
    -> -Z is "front"

    X4 `left_eye_dummy` is at +y from `Bip01 Head`, `Bip01 L Toe0` at +y from
    `Bip01 L Foot`  -> +Y is "front"

so the mapping is `(x, y, z) -> (x, -z, y)`.  Its determinant is **+1**, so the
triangle winding is kept as authored (confirmed: PMX's own vertex normals give
mean dot(face normal, vertex normal) = +0.985, positive = 1.000).

Units
-----
MMD units are arbitrary.  The global Kabsch fit solves the scale; it is *not*
inherited from the previous project (that model was 9.625 cm/unit and this one
is a different author's rig with different proportions).

import numpy as np

#: source bone -> X4 bone, one to one and anatomically unambiguous.
#:
#: Spine: this rig has FOUR segments between the waist and the neck
#: (`下半身` / `上半身` / `上半身3` / `上半身2`) where X4 has three (`Spine` /
#: `Spine1` / `Spine2`), so the mapping has to stay monotonic in height or the
#: torso shears.  Measured heights above the hip joint (`左足D`, y = 10.96):
#:
#:     下半身  y = 12.10   +1.14        X4 Bip01 Spine   +12.38 cm above hip
#:     上半身  y = 12.17   +1.21        X4 Bip01 Spine1  +25.12
#:     上半身3 y = 12.70   +1.74        X4 Bip01 Spine2  +38.84
#:     上半身2 y = 13.51   +2.55        X4 Bip01 Spine2  (shares)
#:
#: MMD deliberately puts `下半身` and `上半身` at almost the same height (they
#: are two rotation centres for the same waist, one driving each half), so the
#: fit cannot match them both; what matters is that the sequence increases.
#: `上半身2` carries the most weight (1705 verts vs 847 for `上半身3`) and is
#: the chest, so it takes the top segment and `上半身3` shares it -- folding a
#: bone onto the *next* one up is exactly what the cloth chains do.
#:
#: `腰` (waist, y = 11.41) is deliberately absent: it is a pass-through
#: semi-standard bone with no skin weights of its own, and mapping it would
#: put a fourth driver inside the same 12 cm of spine.
#:
#: **Exactly one source bone may map to a given X4 bone.**  `上半身3` therefore
#: has no entry of its own and folds onto `上半身` (its parent, and therefore
#: `Bip01 Spine1`) through the normal chain-root rule.
#:
#: This was a real bug.  The first version mapped both `上半身3` and `上半身2`
#: to `Bip01 Spine2` -- "sharing", the way cloth chains fold.  But a *direct*
#: target keeps only one `(src, dst, R)` record, and which source wins depends
#: on dict iteration order; `上半身3` won, so `Bip01 Spine2`'s source position
#: became 119.0 cm instead of `上半身2`'s ~132.  Everything bound to Spine2 was
#: then translated **+13.9 cm upward** -- which is the two back ribbons, whose
#: whole chain folds onto Spine2, being hoisted from the shoulders to above the
#: head.  `_assert_unique_targets()` now makes the mistake impossible.
#:
#: Legs use the **D bones** (`左足D`/`左ひざD`/`左足首D`/`左足先EX`): the plain
#: `左足` chain is the IK chain and carries no weights, the D copies sit at
#: identical positions and carry all of them.
#:
#: `左肩C` and `左肩P` are absent on purpose: `左肩C` is coincident with `左腕`
#: and `左肩P` with `左肩`, so either would fight its twin for the same target.

    #: and the whole leg was 16.4 cm wide at the ankles -- **under half** of
    #: vanilla's 39.8 cm -- so a stride put the feet on one line: the "catwalk"
    #: and the "sitting with the feet almost touching" report are the same
    #: number.  (The source is not at fault: its own leg bones sit 0.7-1.0 cm
    #: from the geometry they drive.)
    #:
    #: What the damping is really setting is the *stride width*, and that is
    #: what the "catwalk" report is about: a catwalk is two feet landing on one

    #: damped build put them 18.0 cm apart, i.e. inside the hips (23 cm), so
    #: every step crossed the midline.  The foot geometry follows its bone, so
    #: the first fix (0.72) only reached 30.5 cm -- still 23% narrower than
    #: vanilla and still reading as a catwalk.  The foot therefore keeps
    #: almost all of the travel (0.95) and the calf most of it (0.85), while
    #: the thigh stays at 0.60: the chain still splays monotonically outwards
    #: like a Biped chain, the ankles land within ~2 cm of vanilla's 17.70,
